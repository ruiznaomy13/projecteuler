# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The problems range in difficulty and require both mathematical insight and programming skills to solve efficiently.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by problem number in the `solutions/` directory:

```
solutions/
├── problem_001.py
├── problem_002.py
├── problem_003.py
└── ...
```

## Languages Used

- Python (primary language for solutions)
- Other languages may be added in the future

## Running Solutions

Each solution file can be executed independently. For Python solutions:

```bash
python solutions/problem_001.py
```

## Problem Solutions

| Problem | Title | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Multiples of 3 or 5 | [problem_001.py](solutions/problem_001.py) |
| 2 | Even Fibonacci Numbers | [problem_002.py](solutions/problem_002.py) |
| 3 | Largest Prime Factor | [problem_003.py](solutions/problem_003.py) |

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute solutions in different languages or optimize existing solutions.

## Note

As per Project Euler's guidelines, only solutions to the first 100 problems should be publicly shared. Please respect this when contributing.
