# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by problem number in the `solutions/` directory:

```
solutions/
├── problem_000.c
├── problem_001.c
├── problem_002.c
└── ...
```

## Running Solutions

Each solution file can be executed independently:

```bash
cc -DNDEBUG -Wall -Wextra -Werror solutions/problem_000.c
```
